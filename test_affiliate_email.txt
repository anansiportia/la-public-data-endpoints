Jack—

If you’ve got an automotive audience (techs, DIYers, shop owners), MadnessBot is built to make car problems easier to explain, faster to diagnose, and simpler to quote.

Why it’s worth sharing:
- Helps turn messy symptoms into clear next steps
- Great for creators who answer “what’s wrong with my car?” all day
- Works for shops too: faster writeups + clearer customer explanations

If you want, reply with the kind of audience you have (DIY vs pro techs vs shop owners) and I’ll send a short custom pitch + a couple post ideas you can drop in immediately.
